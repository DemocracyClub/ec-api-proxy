  <h1>Election information API v1</h1>
  <p>
    Use the election information API to provide your users with all the information they need to take part in
    elections, all in one place.
  </p>
  <p>
    The API uses postcode information to give voters tailored information on where and when to vote, as well
    as the candidates standing for elections in their area.
  </p>
  <p>
    The service is run by <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/">Democracy Club</a>,
    on behalf of the <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/">Electoral Commission</a>.
    Democracy Club is a community
    interest company with a mission to ensure everyone has access to quality information on democratic processes,
    particularly on elections. We work together to make sure voters have the latest information on upcoming elections.
  </p>
  <p>This is a new service. Share your feedback and help us shape the next version.</p>

  <h2>What’s available in v1</h2>


  <h3>Latest election name and date</h3>
  <p>Let your users know what elections are coming up in their area. The API will show dates for every type of election,
    from by-elections to general elections. It also tracks if an election has been cancelled.</p>

  <p>Town, parish and community council elections, and referendums, are not included in this version.</p>

  <h3>Electoral registration contact information</h3>
  <p>Help your users with postal and proxy forms, or electoral registration questions. Provide them with the telephone,
    email, and postal address for their local elections team.</p>

  <p>Two addresses can be displayed for Scotland postcodes: one for the electoral registration team, and another for
    the local council.</p>

  <h3>Polling station information</h3>
  <p>Provide users with the location of their polling station ahead of polling day, and in some cases, a map to help
    plan their route.</p>

  <p>We aim to cover every postcode in the UK, but this isn’t always possible. We ask local councils to share this data
    with us. Unfortunately not all councils do.</p>

  <p>Accuracy is also important to us. Polling station data can only be published if it contains no errors.</p>

  <p>If you work at a local authority and would like to provide polling station data, please follow the
    <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/projects/polling-stations/upload/">few simple
      steps to export data from your EMS</a>.</p>

  <h3>Candidate information</h3>
  <p>Give your users a heads up on who will be on their ballot paper on polling day. The API will show the name of the
    candidate, and the party they’re standing for.</p>
  <h3>Not available in v1</h3>
  <p>Welsh language support is not included in v1. We are working on this for v2.</p>
